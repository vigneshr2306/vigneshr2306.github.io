### <span style="color:#ff4703">short bio</span>

Welcome to my personal website! It's currently under construction, so check back later! :hammer: :wrench:

My name is Sundar Sripada. My most popular nickname is Sippy. People also call me Sips, Sundu, Sun-Sun, Sunz, and my least favourite, Sundi (as it rhymes with an expletive in the Tamil Language). 

I am an incoming Master's student to the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.utexas.edu/){:target="_blank"} at [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/). In the past, I've worked as a Research Intern at the [Robotics Research Center, IIIT-Hyderabad](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}, and as a Summer Research Fellow in the [Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT-Madras](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}. In 2020, I completed my Bachelor's of Engineering in Electronics and Communication Engineering at [Anna University](https://www.annauniv.edu/){:target="_blank"}. 

Some of my hobbies include: reading (mystery & sci-fi), writing (I'm new to blogs!), tennis, and video games (mostly [Valorant](https://playvalorant.com/en-us/){:target="_blank"}).

### <span style="color:#ff4703">research interests</span>

I am passionate about research and engineering in the intersection of Robotics, Computer Vision and Deep Learning. Particularly, I am interested in applying learning-based principles to enable and improve perception tasks in robots (and other applications). I am also into decision-making in autonomous systems, specifically using Model Predictive Control or Reinforcement Learning.
